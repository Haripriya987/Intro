---Setup and Installation of java----
 To run a java program first we need JDK(java Development Toolkit)
JDK contains development tools and JRE(Java RunTime Environment)
we have to download jdk of current version from the official website
After that we have to successfully install it in our system.
 Then we have to set up the path  in our system
By completing all these steps now we can able to run java programs in our system

---First Java Program----

class First
{
  public static void main(String args[])
   {
	System.out.println("Hello world");
    }
}

First we have to save the above program  as First.java in any of text editor with the extention of Java.
Then we have to compile the above program as javac First.java in cmd.javac compiler will convert it into byte code.
Finally we have to run by using java First command .Then it will convert into machine readable code.
It will display the output as Hello World.

----Taking input from the KeyBoard----
By this the user can give the input at the run time of a program
For this we have to use predefined package called util in this it provides a class called  Scanner .
In Scanner class there are some predefined methods are there.
some of them are
nextInt -For Integer values
nextFloat -For float values
nextDouble-For double values
next-For Characters
nextLine-For single Line statements
nextByte 
nextShort
nextLong
nextBoolean

//Sample program for taking input from keyboard
import java.util.Scanner;  //we are importing Scanner class from util Library
class Input
{
  public static void main(String args[])
   {
     Scanner sc=new Scanner(Syastem.in);//creating a object for Scanner class
     int a,b,c;
     System.out.println("Enter any Two Numbers");
     a=sc.nextInt();
     b=sc.nextInt();
     c=a+b;
     System.out.println("Sum is"+c);
   }
}
After saving the above program
we have to compile it and run the program
During the run time we have to give input as a int

//Another Program 
import java.util.Scanner;  //we are importing Scanner class from util Library
class Input
{
  public static void main(String args[])
   {
     Scanner sc=new Scanner(Syastem.in);//creating a object for Scanner class
      String a;
      System.out.println("May i Know your Name");
       a=sc.nextInt();
      System.out.println("My Name is"+a);
    }
}
After saving the above program
we have to compile it and run the program
During the run time we have to give input as a string
